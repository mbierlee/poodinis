Poodinis Tutorial
=================
This tutorial will give you an overview of all functionality offered by Poodinis and how to use them.

The container
-------------
To register a class, a new dependency container must be instantiated:
```d
// Register a private container
auto dependencies = new DependencyContainer();
// Or use the singleton container
dependencies = DependencyContainer.getInstance();
```
###Registering dependencies
To make dependencies available, they have to be registered:
```d
// Register concrete class
dependencies.register!ExampleClass;
// Register by super type
dependencies.register!(ExampleInterface, ExampleClass);
```
In the above example, dependencies on the concrete class and interface will resolve an instance of class ExampleClass. A dependency registered by super type will automatically be registered by concrete type.

Resolving dependencies
----------------------
To manually resolve a dependency, all you have to do is resolve the dependency's type using the container in which it is registered:
```d
auto exampleClassInstance = dependencies.resolve!ExampleClass;
```
If the class is registered by interface and not by concrete type, you can still resolve the class by concrete type:

```d
auto exampleClassInstance = dependencies.resolve!ExampleInterface;
auto exampleClassInstance2 = dependencies.resolve!ExampleClass;
assert(exampleClassInstance is exampleClassInstance2);
```
If you want to prevent registrations from being both registered by interface and concrete type, use the DO_NOT_ADD_CONCRETE_TYPE_REGISTRATION option when registering:
```d
dependencies.register!(ExampleInterface, ExampleClass)(RegistrationOptions.DO_NOT_ADD_CONCRETE_TYPE_REGISTRATION);
auto exampleClassInstance = dependencies.resolve!ExampleInterface;
auto exampleClassInstance2 = dependencies.resolve!ExampleClass; // A ResolveException is thrown
```

Dependency creation behaviour
-----------------
You can control how a dependency is resolved by specifying a creation scope during registration. The scope determines which instance is returned, be it the same each time or a new one. The following scopes are available:

* Resolve a dependency using a single instance (default):

```d
dependencies.register!(ExampleClass).singleInstance();
```
* Resolve a dependency with a new instance each time it is resolved:

```d
dependencies.register!(ExampleClass).newInstance();
```
* Resolve a dependency using a pre-existing instance

```d
auto preExistingInstance = new ExampleClass();
dependencies.register!(ExampleClass).existingInstance(preExistingInstance);
```

Autowiring
----------
The real value of any dependency injection framework comes from its ability to autowire dependencies. Poodinis supports autowiring by simply applying the **@Autowire** UDA to a member of a class:
```d
class ExampleClassA {}

class ExampleClassB {
	@Autowire
	private ExampleClassA dependency;
}

dependencies.register!ExampleClassA;
auto exampleInstance = new ExampleClassB();
dependencies.autowire(exampleInstance);
assert(exampleInstance.dependency !is null);
```
It is possible to autowire public and private members.

Dependencies are automatically autowired when a class is resolved. So when you register ExampleClassB, its member, *dependency*, is automatically autowired:
```d
dependencies.register!ExampleClassA;
dependencies.register!ExampleClassB;
auto instance = dependencies.resolve!ExampleClassB;
assert(instance.dependency !is null);
```
If an interface is to be autowired, you must register a concrete class by interface. Any class registered by concrete type can only be injected when a dependency on a concrete type is autowired.

Circular dependencies
---------------------
Poodinis can autowire circular dependencies when they are registered with singleInstance or existingInstance registration scopes. Circular dependencies in registrations with newInstance scopes will not be autowired, as this would cause an endless loop.

Registering and resolving using qualifiers
------------------------------------------
You can register multiple concrete types to a super type. When doing so, you will need to specify a qualifier when resolving that type:
```d
// Color is an interface, Blue and Red are classes implementing that interface
dependencies.register!(Color, Blue);
dependencies.register!(Color, Red);
auto blueInstance = dependencies.resolve!(Color, Blue);
```
If you want to autowire a type registered to multiple concrete types, specify a qualified type as template argument:
```d
class BluePaint {
	@Autowire!Blue
	public Color color;
}
```
If you registered multiple concrete types to the same supertype and you do not resolve using a qualifier, a ResolveException is thrown stating that there are multiple candidates for the type to be resolved.

Autowiring all registered instances to an array
-----------------------------------------------
If you have registered multiple concrete types to a super type, you can autowire them all to an array, in which case you can easily operate on them all:
```d
// Color is an interface, Blue and Red are classes implementing that interface

class ColorMixer {
	@Autowire
	public Color[] colors;
}

dependencies.register!(Color, Blue);
dependencies.register!(Color, Red);
auto mixer = dependencies.resolve!ColorMixer;
```
Member mixer.colors will now contain instances of Blue and Red. The order of the instances is not guarenteed to be that of the order in which they were registered.

Application Contexts
--------------------
You can fine-tune dependency configuration using application contexts. Application contexts allow you to centralize all dependency configuration as well as define
how instances of certain classes should be constructed using factory methods.
###Defining and using application contexts
An application context is defined as follows:
```d
class Context : ApplicationContext {
	public override void registerDependencies(shared(DependencyContainer) container) {
		container.register!SomeClass;
		container.register!(SomeInterface, SomeOtherClass).newInstance();
	}
	
	@Component
	public SomeLibraryClass libraryClass() {
		return new SomeLibraryClass("This class needs constructor parameters so I have to register it through an application context");
	}
}
```
In the override *registerDependencies()* you can register all dependencies which do not need complex set-up, just like you would do when directly using the dependency container. 
This override is optional. You can still register simple dependencies outside of the context (or in another context).  
Complex dependencies are registered through member methods of the context. These member methods serve as factory methods which will be called when a dependency is resolved. 
They are annotated with the *@Component* UDA to let the container know that these methods should be registered as dependencies. The type of the registration is the same as the return type of the method.  
Factory methods are useful when you have to deal with dependencies which require constructor arguments or elaborate set-up after instantiation.  
Application contexts have to be registered with a dependency container. They are registered as follows:
```d
container.registerContext!Context;
```
All registered dependencies can now be resolved by the same dependency container. Registering a context will also register it as a dependency, meaning you can autowire the application context in other classes. 
You can register as many types of application contexts as you like.

###Autowiring application contexts
Application contexts can make use of autowired dependencies like any other dependency. When registering an application context, all its components are registered first after which the application context is autowired. 
This means that after the registration of an application context some dependencies will already be resolved and instantiated. The following example illustrates how autowired members can be used in a context:
```d
class Context : ApplicationContext {

	@Autowire
	public SomeClass someClass;
	
	@Autowire
	public SomeOtherClass someOtherClass;

	public override void registerDependencies(shared(DependencyContainer) container) {
		container.register!SomeClass;
	}
	
	@Component
	public SomeLibraryClass libraryClass() {
		return new SomeLibraryClass(someClass, someOtherClass);
	}
}
```
As you can see, autowired dependencies can be used within factory methods. When *SomeLibraryClass* is resolved, it will be created with a resolved instance of *SomeClass* and *SomeOtherClass*. As shown, autowired dependencies can be registered within the same
application context, but don't neccesarily have to be. You can even autowire dependencies which are created within a factory method within the same application context.  
Application contexts are directly autowired after they have been registered. This means that all autowired dependencies which are not registered in the application context itself need to be registered before registering the application context.

###Controlling component registration
You can further influence how components are registered and created with additional UDAs:
```d
class Context : ApplicationContext {
	@Component
	@Prototype // Will create a new instance every time the dependency is resolved.
	@RegisterByType!SomeInterface // Registers the dependency by the specified super type instead of the return type
	public SomeClass someClass() {
		return new SomeClass();
	}
}
```
